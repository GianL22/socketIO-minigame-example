# STEAL OR NO STEAL GAME ðŸ’¼
## What is this?

A technical demonstration of socket-based multiplayer interaction, Briefcase Duel is a simple game where players connect to a server and engage in a series of one-on-one duels. Each player chooses a briefcase that is randomly assigned a "SAFED" or "ELIMINATED" status, and their opponent must send a "steal" or "pass" command to the server. The server then resolves the outcome and sends the result back to the clients.
